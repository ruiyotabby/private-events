## Project: Private Events

I built a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

This project will require model of many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names.

Here is the [deployed app](https://hidden-glade-9597.fly.dev/). I apologise for the frontend, focus on the backend.
